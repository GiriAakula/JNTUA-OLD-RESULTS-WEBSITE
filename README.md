# JNTUA-OLD-RESULTS-WEBSITE
The project main aim is to recreate the old JNTUA website. The JNTUA officials recently changed the results site from scratch. The main flaw in this process is they lost all the data of old students. There is no way for them to get those data. Of course, this project doesn't have to do with the lost data. But it provides a short hack to get the results.
